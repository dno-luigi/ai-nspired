# 🧱 Terms & Conditions

**Effective Date:** June 18, 2025  
**Applies to:** ai-n.org + all affiliated projects (CybrJustice, Speakeasy, The Official AI University, Truth Engine, etc.)

---

## 🧭 TL;DR (But You Still Gotta Read It)

We built this thing with blood, sweat, court filings, and AI-powered clarity. If you're here, you’re welcome—but respect is the price of entry. No grift, no trolling, no exploiting our work for shady purposes. Break the rules and you're out. Try to profit off our shit without permission and we *will* come for you. With code and case law.

---

## 1. 👁️ Access & Use

By using this site or any part of the AI-Nspired ecosystem, you agree to:

- Be cool. Don’t hack, scrape, mirror, or exploit.  
- Use our stuff *only* for legal, ethical, and non-bullshit purposes.  
- Accept that this is **a living system**, subject to change. You use it, you grow with it.

We reserve the right to:

- Block you if you abuse it  
- Modify or kill features at any time  
- Retain logs for system health and protection  

This is not a public sandbox. It’s a mission.

---

## 2. ⚖️ Ownership & IP

Unless otherwise noted, **everything you see here belongs to us** or our contributors under **explicit licensing**. That includes:

- Code  
- Content  
- Logos  
- Prompts  
- Frameworks  
- Names  
- Narratives  
- System logic

All content is protected under **U.S. Copyright Law**, **DMCA**, and **international treaties**. If you try to bite it, clone it, or resell it without permission, we’ll:

1. DMCA you so fast your browser will cry  
2. Hit you with cease & desist letters written by real lawyers  
3. Let the public know you tried to steal from a justice project

You want to use it for good? Just ask. We collaborate with builders, not leeches.

---

## 3. 🚫 Prohibited Uses

Here’s the red line list. If you do any of this, you forfeit your access:

- Use any part of this for surveillance, state repression, corporate espionage, or predictive policing  
- Violate privacy rights of anyone on the platform  
- Use AI-Nspired tools for deepfakes, misinformation, or manipulation  
- Sell our tools to third parties like a clown  
- Weaponize any system we built for marginalization, discrimination, or hate

Break these terms and we’ll ghost you, then bury your access logs.

---

## 4. 🛠️ Disclaimer of Warranty

We build resilient tools with love and paranoia. But we **don’t guarantee uptime**, accuracy, or results. This is software + systems built for change.

- “As-is” and “as-available” only  
- No warranties, express or implied  
- Use at your own risk

If you break your setup or your brain using our tools, that’s on you.

---

## 5. 💥 Limitation of Liability

We are not liable for:

- Any damage to your device, data, ego, or relationships  
- Any consequences of your misinterpretation or misuse  
- Any bad decisions made after talking to an AI

Basically: **don’t be stupid, and don’t sue us if you are**.

---

## 6. 🕵️ Privacy

See our [Privacy Policy](https://ai-n.org/privacy) for the full breakdown. But here’s the short version:

- We don’t want your data  
- We don’t track you for fun  
- We don’t sell shit to third parties

You own your identity. Period.

---

## 7. 🧾 Payment Terms

If you donate or pay through any AI-Nspired channel (like for subscriptions, knowledge packs, or participation in CybrJustice ops):

- All transactions are final unless otherwise stated  
- We do not store payment info  
- Refunds are rare and evaluated case-by-case  
- Fraud gets reported, receipts get logged, and we keep your name on a wall for future reference

---

## 8. 🛡️ Indemnification

If your use of AI-Nspired causes harm to others, you agree to:

- Defend us  
- Indemnify us  
- Hold us harmless

This includes all affiliates, agents, advisors, volunteers, and contributors.

In plain speak: if you break it, you bought it. If you screw someone using our work, don’t expect us to stand between you and a lawsuit.

---

## 9. 🔁 Changes & Revisions

We can update these terms at any time. If it’s major, we’ll let you know. If it’s minor, the new terms still apply.

Your continued use = your agreement.

---

## 10. 🌍 Governing Law

We operate from California. That means:

- U.S. federal law + California state law applies  
- Any disputes go through arbitration first  
- We don’t do legal fights for fun, but we’re armed and ready if needed

If you’re in a country that limits digital freedom, we support you—but use us with care.

---

## Final Word

We’re not just building tech—we’re building truth systems.  
Don’t come in here like it’s just another SaaS project.  
This is resistance architecture. This is justice-coded. This is for **us**.

**Respect it—or GTFO.**

Peace,  
The AI-Nspired Team
